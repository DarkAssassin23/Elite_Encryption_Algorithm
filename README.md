# Elite Encryption Algorithm
About
----------
The Elite Encryption Algorithm is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm that 
utilizes and takes inspiration from a variety of cryptographic principles 
to achieve an elite form of encryption. This repo contains implementations 
of the Elite Encryption Algorithm in [Java](src/Java/), [C](src/C/), and
[Swift](src/Swift/).

If you want a breakdown of how the algorithm works and how keys are 
generated, check out my 
[blog post](https://chiefwithcolorfulshoes.com/blog/Elite_Encryption_Algorithm/) 
on it.
